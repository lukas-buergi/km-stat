Technical Notes
1.	'Spurious Free Dynamic Range' (SFDR) is defined as the ratio of the RMS value of the carrier frequency (maximum signal component) at the input of the DAC to the RMS value of the next largest noise or harmonic distortion component at its output.
2.	SFDR is determined directly from the specification table or from the characterisation plots of SFDR versus frequency.

4.	'Adjusted update rate' for DACs:
a.	For conventional (non-interpolating) DACs, the 'adjusted update rate' is the rate at which the digital signal is converted to an analogue signal and the output analogue values are changed by the DAC.  For DACs where the interpolation mode may be bypassed (interpolation factor of one), the DAC should be considered as a conventional (non-interpolating) DAC.
	b.	For interpolating DACs (oversampling DACs), the 'adjusted update rate' is defined as the DAC update rate divided by the smallest interpolating factor. For interpolating DACs, the 'adjusted update rate' may be referred to by different terms including:
