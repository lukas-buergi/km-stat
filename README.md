km-stat: arms export statistics
===============================

This project is intended to help fight against arms exports.

## Documentation

* This file here.
* There is some documentation in docs/manual/documentation.lyx that is partly in German. New parts in English.
* There is lots of documentation in the program files and eventually maybe someone will make it autogenerate html docs from that.

## Licenses

* In principle it's licensed as AGPLv3, see file COPYING. If an individual
source file has no copyright notice then you should check and ask. Files
provided by Django are BSD and files copied from elsewhere might have
any other (hopefully compatible) license.
* There are various files provided by governments and/or treaty
organizations with license status unknown to me.
* I haven't thought about database licenses. Maybe various people who
worked on the database in the past have some database-copyright on it.

## Overview of current status:

* Django/Python backend
* frontend using mostly bare js (some d3.js ...) on top of Django templates for html/css
* various scripts/workflows for gathering and cleaning up data in utils
* fairly complete data set for Kriegsmaterial/bes.mil.GÃ¼ter from Switzerland since 2006, Dual Use is outdated
* soon a cleaned up version of the wassenaar munitions lists, tools being developed in folder utils

## Desired changes:

* Some problems with formatting when using the two non-default display styles
* Sort needs to be enabled in front end
* Display table with one row as sentence instead?
* world map data pop up always towards middle and upwards respective to mouse pointer / touch event
* change year selection to drop down for better mobile support
* display dates better, maybe switch to displaying years and quarters because that's the most fine-grained we have
* make countries click-able at least in table so that it changes to filter to include only that country
* make dates click-able to choose that date onyl?
* Multi language: English first because I can easily do the translation, get help for French and Italian
* make database model English (don't know what I thought when making some parts German in the beginning)

## Local installation:

* Clone
* Create virtualenv
* pip install stuff in requirements.txt file
* setup local settings (copy example)
* setup database (backups are in folder database-backups)
* activate virtualenv: . bin/activate
* ./manage.py runserver

## Push to staging for first time:

* Make sure your public key was added to the server
* Add remote: git remote add km-staging git+ssh://2167433@git.sd6.gpaas.net/default.git
* Create new config file and sftp to server:
sftp 2167433@sftp.sd6.gpaas.net
put gandi-gsoa-staging-settingsLocal.py vhosts/default/kriegsmaterialch/settingsLocal.py

## Push to staging:

There is also a script in ./utils

* Commit
* Push to staging: git push km-staging master
* ssh 2167433@git.sd6.gpaas.net deploy default.git
* ./manage.py collectstatic
* sftp static folder to server:
cd kriegsmaterialch
sftp 2167433@sftp.sd6.gpaas.net
cd /lamp0/web/vhosts/default/
put -r static
* necessary to sftp config file to server?
* reload application from control interface
