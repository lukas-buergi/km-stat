2.B.Technical Notes.1.	Secondary parallel contouring axes, (e.g., the w-axis on horizontal boring mills or a secondary rotary axis the centre line of which is parallel to the primary rotary axis) are not counted in the total number of contouring axes.  Rotary axes need not rotate over 360°.  A rotary axis can be driven by a linear device (e.g., a screw or a rack-and-pinion). 
2.B.Technical Notes.2.	For the purposes of 2.B., the number of axes which can be co-ordinated simultaneously for "contouring control" is the number of axes along or around which, during processing of the workpiece, simultaneous and interrelated motions are performed between the workpiece and a tool. This does not include any additional axes along or around which other relative motions within the machine are performed, such as:
2.B.Technical Notes.2.a.	Wheel-dressing systems in grinding machines;
2.B.Technical Notes.2.b.	Parallel rotary axes designed for mounting of separate workpieces;

2.B.Technical Notes.4.	For the purposes of this Category a "tilting spindle" is counted as a rotary axis.
2.B.Technical Notes.5.	'Stated "unidirectional positioning repeatability"' may be used for each machine tool model as an alternative to individual machine tests, and is determined as follows:

2.B.Technical Notes.5.b.	Measure the linear axis repeatability (R↑,R↓) according to ISO 230-2:2014 and evaluate "unidirectional positioning repeatability" for each axis of each of the five machines;
2.B.Technical Notes.5.c.	Determine the arithmetic mean value of the "unidirectional positioning repeatability"-values for each axis of all five machines together.  These arithmetic mean values of "unidirectional positioning repeatability" ($\overline{UPR}$) become the stated value of each axis for the model ($\overline{UPR}_{x}$, $\overline{UPR}_{y}$, …)
2.B.Technical Notes.5.d.	Since the Category 2 list refers to each linear axis there will be as many 'stated "unidirectional positioning repeatability"'-values as there are linear axes;
2.B.Technical Notes.5.e.	If any axis of a machine model not specified by 2.B.1.a. to 2.B.1.c. has a 'stated "unidirectional positioning repeatability"' equal to or less than the specified "unidirectional positioning repeatability" of each machine tool model plus 0.7 µm, the builder should be required to reaffirm the accuracy level once every eighteen months.
2.B.Technical Notes.6.	For the purposes of 2.B., measurement uncertainty for the "unidirectional positioning repeatability" of machine tools, as defined in the International Standard ISO 230-2:2014 or national equivalents, shall not be considered.
2.B.Technical Notes.7.	For the purpose of 2.B., the measurement of axes shall be made according to test procedures in 5.3.2. of ISO 230-2:2014.  Tests for axes longer than 2 meters shall be made over 2 m segments.  Axes longer than 4 m require multiple tests (e.g., two tests for axes longer than 4 m and up to 8 m, three tests for axes longer than 8 m and up to 12 m), each over 2 m segments and distributed in equal intervals over the axis length.  Test segments are equally spaced along the full axis length, with any excess length equally divided at the beginning, in between, and at the end of the test segments.  The smallest "unidirectional positioning repeatability"-value of all test segments is to be reported.

2.E.3.f.Technical Note.	Processes specified in Column 1 of the Table are defined as follows:
2.E.3.f.Technical Note.a.	Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) is an overlay coating or surface modification coating process wherein a metal, alloy, "composite", dielectric or ceramic is deposited upon a heated substrate.  Gaseous reactants are decomposed or combined in the vicinity of a substrate resulting in the deposition of the desired elemental, alloy or compound material on the substrate.  Energy for this decomposition or chemical reaction process may be provided by the heat of the substrate, a glow discharge plasma, or "laser" irradiation.
2.E.3.f.Technical Note.a.N.B.1	CVD includes the following processes: directed gas flow out-of-pack deposition, pulsating CVD, controlled nucleation thermal deposition (CNTD), plasma enhanced or plasma assisted CVD processes.
2.E.3.f.Technical Note.a.N.B.2	Pack denotes a substrate immersed in a powder mixture.
2.E.3.f.Technical Note.a.N.B.3	The gaseous reactants used in the out-of-pack process are produced using the same basic reactions and parameters as the pack cementation process, except that the substrate to be coated is not in contact with the powder mixture.
2.E.3.f.Technical Note.b.	Thermal Evaporation-Physical Vapour Deposition (TE-PVD) is an overlay coating process conducted in a vacuum with a pressure less than 0.1 Pa wherein a source of thermal energy is used to vaporize the coating material.  This process results in the condensation, or deposition, of the evaporated species onto appropriately positioned substrates.
2.E.3.f.Technical Note.b.	The addition of gases to the vacuum chamber during the coating process to synthesize compound coatings is an ordinary modification of the process.
2.E.3.f.Technical Note.b.	The use of ion or electron beams, or plasma, to activate or assist the coating's deposition is also a common modification in this technique.  The use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thickness of coatings can be a feature of these processes.
2.E.3.f.Technical Note.b.	Specific TE-PVD processes are as follows:
2.E.3.f.Technical Note.b.1.	Electron Beam PVD uses an electron beam to heat and evaporate the material which forms the coating;
2.E.3.f.Technical Note.b.2.	Ion Assisted Resistive Heating PVD employs electrically resistive heating sources in combination with impinging ion beam(s) to produce a controlled and uniform flux of evaporated coating species;
2.E.3.f.Technical Note.b.3.	"Laser" Vaporization uses either pulsed or continuous wave "laser" beams to vaporize the material which forms the coating;
2.E.3.f.Technical Note.b.4.	Cathodic Arc Deposition employs a consumable cathode of the material which forms the coating and has an arc discharge established on the surface by a momentary contact of a ground trigger.  Controlled motion of arcing erodes the cathode surface creating a highly ionized plasma.  The anode can be either a cone attached to the periphery of the cathode, through an insulator, or the chamber.  Substrate biasing is used for non line-of-sight deposition;
2.E.3.f.Technical Note.b.4.N.B.	This definition does not include random cathodic arc deposition with non-biased substrates.
2.E.3.f.Technical Note.b.5.	Ion Plating is a special modification of a general TE-PVD process in which a plasma or an ion source is used to ionize the species to be deposited, and a negative bias is applied to the substrate in order to facilitate the extraction of the species from the plasma.  The introduction of reactive species, evaporation of solids within the process chamber, and the use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thicknesses of coatings are ordinary modifications of the process. 
2.E.3.f.Technical Note.c.	Pack Cementation is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process wherein a substrate is immersed in a powder mixture (a pack), that consists of:
2.E.3.f.Technical Note.c.1.	The metallic powders that are to be deposited (usually aluminium, chromium, silicon or combinations thereof);
2.E.3.f.Technical Note.c.2.	An activator (normally a halide salt); and
2.E.3.f.Technical Note.c.3.	An inert powder, most frequently alumina.
2.E.3.f.Technical Note.c.	The substrate and powder mixture is contained within a retort which is heated to between 1,030 K (757°C) and 1,375 K (1,102°C) for sufficient time to deposit the coating.
2.E.3.f.Technical Note.d.	Plasma Spraying is an overlay coating process wherein a gun (spray torch) which produces and controls a plasma accepts powder or wire coating materials, melts them and propels them towards a substrate, whereon an integrally bonded coating is formed.  Plasma spraying constitutes either low pressure plasma spraying or high velocity plasma spraying.
2.E.3.f.Technical Note.d.N.B.1	Low pressure means less than ambient atmospheric pressure.
2.E.3.f.Technical Note.d.N.B.2	High velocity refers to nozzle-exit gas velocity exceeding 750 m/s calculated at 293 K (20°C) at 0.1 MPa.


2.E.3.f.Technical Note.e.	Slurry Deposition is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process wherein a metallic or ceramic powder with an organic binder is suspended in a liquid and is applied to a substrate by either spraying, dipping or painting, subsequent air or oven drying, and heat treatment to obtain the desired coating.
2.E.3.f.Technical Note.f.	Sputter Deposition is an overlay coating process based on a momentum transfer phenomenon, wherein positive ions are accelerated by an electric field towards the surface of a target (coating material).  The kinetic energy of the impacting ions is sufficient to cause target surface atoms to be released and deposited on an appropriately positioned substrate.
2.E.3.f.Technical Note.f.N.B.1	The Table refers only to triode, magnetron or reactive sputter deposition which is used to increase adhesion of the coating and rate of deposition and to radio frequency (RF) augmented sputter deposition used to permit vaporisation of non-metallic coating materials.
2.E.3.f.Technical Note.f.N.B.2	Low-energy ion beams (less than 5 keV) can be used to activate the deposition.
2.E.3.f.Technical Note.g.	Ion Implantation is a surface modification coating process in which the element to be alloyed is ionized, accelerated through a potential gradient and implanted into the surface region of the substrate.  This includes processes in which ion implantation is performed simultaneously with electron beam physical vapour deposition or sputter deposition.
