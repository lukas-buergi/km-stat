4.Technical Note.	TECHNICAL NOTE ON 'ADJUSTED PEAK PERFORMANCE' ('APP')


4.Technical Note.	'APP' is an adjusted peak rate at which "digital computers" perform 64-bit or larger floating point additions and multiplications.

4.Technical Note.	Abbreviations used in this Technical Note

4.Technical Note.	n: number of processors in the "digital computer"
4.Technical Note.	i: processor number (i,...n)
4.Technical Note.	ti: processor cycle time (ti = 1/Fi)
4.Technical Note.	Fi: processor frequency 
4.Technical Note.	Ri: peak floating point calculating rate
4.Technical Note.	Wi: architecture adjustment factor

4.Technical Note.	'APP' is expressed in Weighted TeraFLOPS (WT), in units of 1012 adjusted floating point operations per second.

4.Technical Note.	Outline of 'APP' calculation method

4.Technical Note.1.	For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating point operations, FPOi, performed per cycle for each processor in the "digital computer".

4.Technical Note.1.Note.	In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions or multiplications.  All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle.  For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating point operands of 64-bit or more, the effective calculating rate R is zero.

4.Technical Note.2.	Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor   Ri = FPOi/ti

4.Technical Note.3.	Calculate 'APP' as 'APP' = W1 x R1 + W2 x R2 + … + Wn x Rn.


4.Technical Note.4.	For 'vector processors', Wi = 0.9.  For non-'vector processors', Wi = 0.3.


4.Technical Note.Note 1.	For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as addition and multiplication, each operation is counted.

4.Technical Note.Note 2.	For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.

4.Technical Note.Note 3.	The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the 'APP' of the combination is derived.  Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.





4.Technical Note.Note 4.	Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating 'APP'.

4.Technical Note.Note 5.	'APP' values are not to be calculated for processor combinations (inter)connected by "Local Area Networks", Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by "software".

4.Technical Note.Note 6.	'APP' values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors specially designed to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory;

4.Technical Note.Note 6.Technical Notes.1.	Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die.
4.Technical Note.Note 6.Technical Notes.2.	Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using "electronic assemblies" specified in 4.A.3.c.

4.Technical Note.Note 7.	A 'vector processor' is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.
