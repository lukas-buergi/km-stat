	Technical Note
	The glass transition temperature (Tg) for 1.C.10.e. materials is  determined using the method described in ASTM D 3418 using the dry method.  The glass transition temperature for phenolic and epoxy resins is determined using the method described in ASTM D 4065 at a frequency of 1Hz and a heating rate of 2 K (°C) per minute using the dry method.
