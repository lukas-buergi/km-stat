Most of the favicon files were generated with [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) [v0.16](https://realfavicongenerator.net/change_log#v0.16).

They are all based on a hand-tuned svg file that I Lukas BÃ¼rgi created.
Someone probably has a copyright and/or trademark on the GSoA logo, I
don't know.
